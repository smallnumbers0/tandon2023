Question 3:
The number e is an important mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. e also arises in the study of compound interest, and in many other applications.
Background of e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)
e can be calculated as the sum of the infinite series: ùëí=1+!+!+!+!+‚ãØ
!! #! $! %!
The value of e is approximately equal to 2.71828. We can get an approximate value of e, by calculating only a partial sum of the infinite sum above (the more addends we add, the better approximation we get).
Implement the function:
double eApprox(int n)
This function is given a positive integer n, and returns an approximation of e, calculated by the sum of the first (n+1) addends of the infinite sum above.
To test your function use the following main:
int main() { cout.precision(30);
for (int n = 1; n <= 15; n++) {
cout<<"n = "<<n<<'\t'<<eApprox(n)<<endl; }
return 0; }
Notes:
1. Pay attention to the running time of eApprox. An efficient implementation would run in
Œò(ùëõ).
2. Since the values of the factorials will grow to be very large, use a variable of type double
to store them.
