Question 4:
a.
Implement a function:
void printDivisors(int num)
This function is given a positive integer num, and prints all of num’s divisors in an ascending
order, separated by a space.
For Example, if we call printDivisors(100), the expected output is:
1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 100
Implementation requirement: Pay attention to the running time of your function. An
efficient implementation would run in Θ%√𝑛𝑢𝑚).
Use the function above when implementing a program that reads from the user a positive
integer (≥2), and prints all it’s divisors.
Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:
Please enter a positive integer >= 2: 100
1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 100
