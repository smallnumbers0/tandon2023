/*
The Fibonacci numbers sequence, Fn, is defined as follows:
F1 is1,F2 is1,andFn =Fn-1 +Fn-2forn=3,4,5,...
In other words, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first 10 numbers in Fibonacci sequence are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
Note: Background of Fibonacci sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
1. Write a function int fib(int n) that returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci
sequence.
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer num, and then
prints the numâ€™s elements in the Fibonacci sequence.Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:
Please enter a positive integer: 7
13
