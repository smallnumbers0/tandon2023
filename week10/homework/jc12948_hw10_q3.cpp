// Question 3:
// In this question, you will write two versions of a program that reads from the user a sequence of positive integers ending with -1, and another positive integer num that the user wishes to search for.
// The program should then print all the line numbers in sequence entered by the user, that contain num, or a message saying that num does not show at all in the sequence.
// 13
// 5
// 8
// 2
// 9
// 5
// 8
// 8
// -1
// Please enter a number you want to search. 5
// 5 shows in lines 2, 6.
// a) The first version of the program, is not allowed to use the vector data structure.
// b) The second version of the program, should use the vector data structure.
// Implementation requirements (for both programs):
// 1. Think how to break down your implementation to functions.
// 2. Your programs should run in linear time. That is, if there are n numbers in the input
// sequence, your program should run in ùúÉ(ùëõ).
// 3. Write the two programs in two functions named main1() and main2(). Also have
// the main() test these two functions.
